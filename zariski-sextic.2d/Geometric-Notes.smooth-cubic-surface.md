= Geometric introduction into the branch curve of a smooth cubic
surface =

*(Under generic projection)*

  Consider a three-dimensional projective space $`P^3`$ with
homogeneous coordinates $`(x, y, w, z)`$. 

  A cubic surface $`S`$ in the projective space is given, after a linear
change of coordinates, by an equation of the form

```math
   f(z) = z^3 − 3 a z + b = 0,
```

 where a and b are homogeneous forms in $`(x, y, w) $ of degrees 2 and 3,
and the projection to the projective pane is is given by 

```math
   (x, y, w, z) → (x, y, w). 
```

In these coordinates the ramification curve R is given by the ideal
```math
   (f, f') = (f, z^2 − a) = (z^3 − 12 b, z^2 − a) 
```

and the branch curve $` B `$, the image of R under the projection, is given by the discriminant

```math
   ∆(f) = b^2 − 4 a^3
```
In particular, one can easily see that the branch curve has six cusps at the
intersection of the plane conic defined by $`a`$ and the plane cubic defined by $`b`$,

(Besides the usual algebraic interpretation of the condition $`(f = f_z = 0)`$
on the polynomial f to have a multiple root in z, there is also a nice
geometric interpretation of the ramification curve R being the
intersection of the surface S and the polar surface S' with respect to
the projection center O; the curve R consists of all the points on the
surface S where the line joining p and the projection center o is
tangent to the surface.)


We give two geometric illustrations (visualisations) where all the coefficients are defined over
real numbers (and, moreover, real algebraic numbers).


(These topic is completely classical; this particular illustration was
written for the paper "On ramified covers of the projective plane I: Segre's theory and
classification in small degrees, with Appendix by Eugenii Shustin", by
